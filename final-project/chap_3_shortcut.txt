The path Red chose led her deeper into the heart of the forest. The trees grew denser, and the air felt heavier. As she ventured further, a figure emerged from the shadows - a large, cunning wolf with piercing eyes. The wolf approached Red with a sly grin, its gaze fixed intently on her.

Wolf's Opening Remark: "Well, well, what do we have here? A little girl all alone in the woods. Where might you be going?"

Red's Response Options:
---
"I'm off to my Granny's house. She lives just beyond the forest." (Reveals information)

"That's for me to know. I'm not supposed to talk to strangers." (Conceals information)
