Armed with the knowledge of the wolf's presence, Little Red Riding Hood steeled herself for what might come next. As she approached the bedroom door, her heart pounded in her chest. She remembered the wolf's footprints leading to this very room. With a deep breath, she pushed the door open, ready to face whatever danger lay inside.
The bedroom was dimly lit, the curtains drawn. There, in Granny's bed, lay a figure with a nightcap, its back turned to Red. Something was off â€“ the figure was too large, the breathing too heavy. It was the wolf, disguised in Granny's clothing, waiting for its next victim. Red's mind raced as she considered her options.
