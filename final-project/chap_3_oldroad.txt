Choosing the longer, winding path, Little Red Riding Hood made her way through the serene and peaceful parts of the forest. Birds sang in harmony, and the sunlight peeked through the leaves, creating a tapestry of light and shadow on the ground. After a while, the familiar sight of Granny's cozy cottage appeared in the distance, nestled at the edge of the woods. Red's heart filled with relief and joy as she approached the doorstep.
