The morning sun poured its golden light through the windows of a cozy cottage where Little Red Riding Hood was preparing for her journey. Her mother bustled around the kitchen, packing a basket full of fresh bread and sweet jam for Granny, who was unwell. The aroma of baked goods filled the air. As she handed the basket to Red, her mother's voice was tinged with concern, "Remember, dear, the forest can be tricky. Stay on the path and be wary of strangers."

Red: "Mom, do you think the forest is really that dangerous?"

Mother's Response: "It can be, dear. Just be careful and avoid straying from the path. And beware of the wolf that roams there."

Red needs to pass through a big forest to go to grandma's house. Now she can choose your own departure time.

Early Morning Departure: "I should leave now, in the cool of the morning. The forest will be less intimidating in the sunlight."

Afternoon Departure: "Maybe I'll wait a bit longer. The forest is more beautiful in the afternoon light, even though it might be riskier."
