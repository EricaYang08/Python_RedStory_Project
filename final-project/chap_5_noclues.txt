Little Red Riding Hood, with no clues to warn her of the lurking danger, stepped into Granny's bedroom, where the familiar comfort of her grandmother's presence was expected. The room was dim, the curtains drawn shut, casting a soft, serene ambiance. There, in the bed, lay a figure shrouded in blankets, wearing Granny's familiar nightcap.

Red, unaware of the peril before her, approached the bed with a gentle smile. "Granny, I've brought you some food," she announced softly. The figure in the bed stirred, making a show of weakness and age. "Come closer, my dear," croaked a feeble voice, skillfully mimicking her grandmother's tone.

Oblivious to the danger, Red moved closer, her eyes filled with concern for her ailing grandmother. As she leaned in, the figure suddenly shifted, revealing the wolf's true form. The beast had cunningly disguised itself, having already devoured poor Granny.

With a swift move, the wolf pounced on the unsuspecting Red. Her little basket fell to the floor, forgotten, as she found herself in the clutches of the wolf. The room, once a haven of childhood memories, now echoed with the triumph of the wolf's deception.
